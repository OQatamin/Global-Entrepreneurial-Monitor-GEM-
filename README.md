# Global-Entrepreneurial-Monitor-GEM-

As my master's thesis focused on exploring entrepreneurial trends in aging societies, I conducted an analysis of the Global Entrepreneurial Monitor surveys. Consequently, I continued to extract insights from the same dataset. 

While entrepreneurship can have various meanings and definitions, GEM defines it as any effort to create a new business or venture, whether it's self-employment, starting a new organization, or growing an existing business. GEM's definition is not limited to newly registered businesses, unlike many official records. It takes an occupational perspective, considering individuals who exhibit entrepreneurial behavior within organizations (intrapreneurship or corporate entrepreneurship).

This analysis employs a comprehensive dataset derived from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) 2019 to explore key indicators and motivations influencing entrepreneurship across various countries and regions. Utilizing advanced data visualization techniques and statistical analyses, including Python libraries like pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and interactive web applications with Dash and Dash Bootstrap Components, the study sheds light on the intricate landscape of entrepreneurship.

The investigation is structured around several core analyses, focusing on fear of failure, future startup intentions, perceptions of opportunities, and acquaintance with entrepreneurs. By categorizing data based on geographical regions and countries, the analysis provides nuanced insights into the global entrepreneurial spirit. Gauge charts reveal individual country metrics on fear of failure and startup intentions, offering a direct comparison of entrepreneurial sentiment and potential barriers to entry.

Further, the study delves into the motives behind entrepreneurship, distinguishing between male and female entrepreneurs to uncover gender-specific drivers. This comparison is crucial in understanding the diverse motivations that propel individuals into entrepreneurship, ranging from the desire to make a difference, to wealth creation, family tradition, and the pursuit of a dream.

Sector analysis within the early-stage and established business domains highlights the varied fields entrepreneurs are engaging in, from extractive and transforming sectors to business-oriented and consumer-oriented services. This segmentation provides a clearer picture of where entrepreneurial efforts are concentrated and the sectors that hold the most appeal or potential for innovation.

Additionally, the research examines the relationship between several key variables using scatter plots and regression analysis, such as the correlation between future startup intentions and factors like knowledge of entrepreneurs, skills, fear of failure, and perceived opportunities. This multifaceted approach not only identifies correlations but also brings to light the complex interplay of factors that influence the decision to embark on an entrepreneurial journey.

In conclusion, this analysis offers a detailed exploration of the dynamics of entrepreneurship on a global scale, identifying pivotal trends, motivations, and barriers. Through a blend of statistical analysis and interactive visualization, it contributes valuable insights to policymakers, researchers, and practitioners aiming to foster a supportive environment for entrepreneurs worldwide.
