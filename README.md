# Global-Entrepreneurial-Monitor-GEM-

As my master's thesis focused on exploring entrepreneurial trends in aging societies, I conducted an analysis of the Global Entrepreneurial Monitor surveys. Consequently, I continued to extract insights from the same dataset. 

While entrepreneurship can have various meanings and definitions, GEM defines it as any effort to create a new business or venture, whether it's self-employment, starting a new organization, or growing an existing business. GEM's definition is not limited to newly registered businesses, unlike many official records. It takes an occupational perspective, considering individuals who exhibit entrepreneurial behavior within organizations (intrapreneurship or corporate entrepreneurship).

The APS survey, which stands for Adult Population Survey, is an integral part of the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) research. It is designed to gather data and insights on various aspects of entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial behavior within the adult population.

The APS survey collects information on individuals' involvement in entrepreneurial activities, including the rates of entrepreneurship, the motivations behind starting a business, the types of businesses started, and the challenges faced by entrepreneurs. It also explores the attitudes, perceptions, and aspirations of individuals towards entrepreneurship.

By conducting the APS survey, GEM aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the entrepreneurial landscape in different countries and regions. The survey results contribute to the analysis of entrepreneurial ecosystems, policy recommendations, and comparisons between economies.
